public class Notes {
//    (1) CLASSES(its templete includes properties and func.) AND OBJECTS(refrence):
//    (2) ACCESS MODIFIERS : PRIVATE --> ACCESEBLE UDER ONLY CLASS,
//                       DEFAULT--> ACCESEBLE UDER ONLY PACKAGE,
//                       PROTECTED --> ACCESEBLE WITHIN THE PACKEGE, AND OUTSIDE THE PACKAGE ONLY THROUGH
//                                                                   sub-class/child-class/derived-class.
//                       PUBLIC --> ACCESEBLE EVERYWHERE WITHIN THE SAME PACKAGE,
//    (3) GETTER AND SETTER: for reset and getting value of non accessible properties.
//    (4) THIS KEYWORD: "this" refference to current object. and we can differentiate b/w local-variable and objects properties.
//    (5) CONSTRUCTORS: for putting value in object properties. And it calls only once when object is created
//    (6) FINAL KEYWORD: for SETED ONLY ONCE AND WITH CAPITAL LETTER VARIABLE_NAMES.
//    (7) PROTECTED: can accessible Outsite the packege but through with extended/child class.
//    (8) STATIC KEYWORD: belongs to class instead of object. And static variables shared by all objects.
//                        static func contains only static properties/variables.


//    (9)THERE FOUR OOPS concept/components :
//                 ABSTRACTION-> Abstraction means showing only necessary details to the user(ex: i/o).
//                               and abstract method uncomplete itself for further implementation.
//                 ENCAPSULATION-> (capsulating things in a class, like properties, constructer, getter and setter)
//                                  Encapsulation is hiding of data from outside world
//                 POLYMORPHISM-> One thing can capable of taking multiple form.
//                                like parent refrence can contain child object.
//                 INHERITANCE-> Inheritance is acquiring properties of other class.

//    (10)FUNCTION OVERLOADING: if any func is called through objects, then firstly find in its own class
//                              then inheritence class.
//    (11) Super Key: when parent and child class have same prop/func then it used for calling parent prop/func.
//    (12) Inheritance and Constructor: parent defalut constructer will be called first then child constructer.
//                                      if default constructer is not available in parent then difine through super
//                                      in child constructer which constructer should be called from parent.
//    (13) Class cast and Object Class: ??
//    (14) Exception Handling: (1)Error: some hardware failed  (2) Unchecked: throw Unexpected error  (3) checked: throw expected error

//    (15) Abstract Keyword and Objects: Abstract class cant create any objects b/c it's showing uncompleteness.
//                                       child class also show incompleteness due to inheritence of abstract class
//                                       so, child class have two options 1: complete the incopmleteness or
//                                                                        2: make abstract itself.
//    (16) Abstract and Inheritance Chain: abstract class can be completed by multiple child classes.

//    (17) Interface: it is pure abstract Means it has abstract-methods only instead of non-abstract method.
//                    it can not create objects due to incopleteness but it can create reference and contains
//                    objects of those class that is implemented of all methods of interface.
//    (18) Interface and Inheritance: declared variables in interface will be public final static bydefault.
//                -> Interfaces cant create obj. but its create refrence and contain those obj. of class
//                   that are implementing of refrence.
//                -> class is extended by other class and Interface is implemented by other class.
//                -> A class can't extend more than one class but its implement more than one interfaces.

//    (19) Generics: A class of Pair<T>. and its save us time to creat diff-diff class.
//    (20) Chained generic pairs:
//    (21) Generics methods:
//    (22) Bounded Generics:
